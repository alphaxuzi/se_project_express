# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The project at the moment features a server using express, as well as a database using mongoDB. Eventually users will be able to create profiles, add clothing items, as well as being able to save them to a genuine database.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
